- Update existing records easily.  
- Retrieve and display transcripts in a clear format.  
- Lightweight and user-friendly design.  

## Requirements  
- **Programming Language:** C++  
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or an IDE like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio).  

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/transcript-management-system.git  
   cd transcript-management-system
